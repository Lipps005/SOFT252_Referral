Please note, that the newly created UID now shows as a label underneath the registration form. This UID will be overwritten if a new user is created, or if the program is closed. The easist way to retreive this is to look in the users/ folder. 

Please note, closing a Users home window will exit the program.

Please note, that although you can login as two users at once, changes, actions or events made by one user are not updated in another users window. Please close the user window and restart the program to see the changes. This does not apply to changes made within a users window, such as responding to requests, or adding new prescriptions to an appointment.   

Please note, a secretary must be created BEFORE a patient. This is because account action requests are sent to the first available secretary. Requesting a patient account BEFORE a secretary account exists will mean you will be unable to login as that patient, or change their account status.

Admin accounts work by typing any UID beginning with A into the login form, along with your chosen password. If the account does not exist, it will be created. You can then click log in again to log in.
